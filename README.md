# CN

CN is a tool for verifying that C code is free of undefined behaviour and meets
user-written specifications of its ownership and functional correctness, and for translating those specifications into
C assertions that can be checked at runtime on concrete test cases.
It builds on the [Cerberus C semantics](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus).

## Tutorial

See the [tutorial documentation](https://rems-project.github.io/cn-tutorial/).

## Installation

Below are the installation instructions for installing CN,
and its dependencies.


1. Install make, git, GMP library, pkg-config and either/both Z3 or CVC5.
   On an Ubuntu system this is done via
   ```
   sudo apt install build-essential libgmp-dev pkg-config z3
   ```
   Note: there is a [known bug with Z3 version
   4.8.13](https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus/issues/663) (the default on
   Ubuntu 22.04) so you may wish to install Z3 via opam later for a more
   up-to-date version. Z3 that is provided in the docker images is sufficiently up-to-date.

2. Install the opam package manager for OCaml:
   https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml#install-opam.
   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt install opam`.

3. Initialise opam with a recent version of OCaml (the CI builds with 4.14.1,
   CN developers use 5.2.0).
   ```
   opam init --yes --compiler=5.2.0
   ````

   Make sure you follow the instructions provided at the end of the output of `opam init` to complete the initialisation. Typically, on Unix, this is:

   ```
   eval $(opam env)
   ```

4. Clone the CN repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rems-project/cn.git
   ```

5. For CN end users, who don't want to tinker with CN locally:
   ```
   opam install --yes ./cn.opam # z3 for a more recent version
   ```

6. For CN developers:
   ```
   opam install --deps-only ./cn.opam ocamlformat.0.27.0 # one time
   make install # after any edits
   ```
   which installs CN (as both a library and an executable), and
   dependencies.
